Project Requirements & Objectives  | Complete
:------------- | :-------------: |
*Project Team Members*: Marty Fitchen, Maarja Laineste, August von Trapp, Noah Yasskin | X
*Project Name*: _**Ice Pick**_ ... We chose this project to create an Epicodus-specific game/app to get to know fellow Epicodus students better. | X
*Project Purpose*: We hope the game/app is a fun way to learn more about the goings on at Epicodus and some interesting facts about fellow students at Epicodus. | X
*Project Process*: We worked very well together. Every morning we would have a stand up reviewing the previous day's work and discussing objectives for the day. Then after lunch we would quickly meet again to discuss must-haves to complete before the day's end. | X
*Project Challenge*: One of the biggest challenges we faced was getting user data (i.e., Epicodus students to come take a picture and input their information) without divulging too much of what our project was to be. Surprisingly most people were happy to help and shared their curiosity. Another big challenge was getting the finished version of the app on Heroku, but August was able to crack it and push our game live. | X
*Project Next Steps*: Our main goal for the app if we had more time to work on it would be to create a way for the Pair Picking process to be more dynamic (and not just a random pull from an Excel spreadsheet) and based on your knowledge of your classmates by taking multiple quizzes (i.e., track-specific quizzes). | X
*Objective*: Participation in creating and presenting a project. | X
*Objective*: Collaborate effectively with teammates. | X
